                <div>At the heart of India Unlocked is an innovative and engaging digital map of India. Each state on the map has been designed to provide brief information when you hover over it, offering a glimpse of what makes it special. Clicking on a state takes you further into a detailed webpage filled with rich content, including its history, key landmarks, festivals, cuisine, and more. This intuitive experience allows users to explore India in a visually compelling and user-friendly way.</div>

                <div>Our 3D model of India, created using Spline, enhances the interactive experience, providing a smooth and realistic visualization of the map.

                <div>The project is built using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TailwindCSS. These technologies work together to create a dynamic and responsive design that adapts to various devices, ensuring that users enjoy the experience whether they are browsing from a mobile phone, tablet, or desktop. TailwindCSS, in particular, has allowed us to maintain a clean and modern aesthetic, making the map not only functional but visually appealing.
